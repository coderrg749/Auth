# Auth
1 Fully working auth Api's ,you can use this in any of your Node JS project , email and phone number verification and a lot more...
2 Just set the values of various env Variable .
3 For sending Otp's on mail i have used nodemailer which is a very popular package for sending emails.
4 For sending Otp's on mobile/phone numbers i have used Twilio , You can create a free twilio account and set the creds in env and everything will work well.
5 User can login with email or username alongside password.
6 JOI is used for validation req bodies , each auth api req body is validated with JOI.
7 Jwts are used almost everywhere where they are required so all the api's are highly secure .
8 Proper MVC pattern is followed so you can clone the project and make it as a starting point for your development.
# This is perfect working auth api's so you can ,modify according to your needs and can use in your project and can go for further development!!!!!!
# Happy Coding!!!!!!!!!!
